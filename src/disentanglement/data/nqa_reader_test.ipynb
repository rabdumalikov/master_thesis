Demonstrating the heights of plants from the two parent variations and their F1 heterozygous hybrid ( centre ) . <P> Dominance in genetics is a relationship between alleles of one gene , in which the effect on phenotype of one allele masks the contribution of a second allele at the same locus . The first allele is dominant and the second allele is recessive . For genes on an autosome ( any chromosome other than a sex chromosome ) , the alleles and their associated traits are autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive . Dominance is a key concept in Mendelian inheritance and classical genetics . Often the dominant allele codes for a functional protein whereas the recessive allele does not . </P> <P> A classic example of dominance is the inheritance of seed shape in peas . Peas may be round , associated with allele R or wrinkled , associated with allele r . In this case , three combinations of alleles ( genotypes ) are possible : RR , Rr , and rr . The RR individuals have round peas and the rr individuals have wrinkled peas . In Rr individuals the R allele masks the presence of the r allele , so these individuals also have round peas . Thus , allele R is dominant to allele r , and allele r is recessive to allele R . This use of upper case letters for dominant alleles and lower case ones for recessive alleles is a widely followed convention . </P> <P> More generally , where a gene exists in two allelic versions ( designated A and a ) , three combinations of alleles are possible : AA , Aa , and aa . If AA and aa individuals ( homozygotes ) show different forms of some trait ( phenotypes ) , and Aa individuals ( heterozygotes ) show the same phenotype as AA individuals , then allele A is said to dominate , be dominant to or show dominance to allele a , and a is said to be recessive to A . </P> <P> Dominance is not inherent to either an allele or its phenotype . It is a relationship between two alleles of a gene and their associated phenotypes ; one allele can be dominant over a second allele , recessive to a third allele , and codominant to a fourth . Also , an allele may be dominant for a particular aspect of phenotype but not for other aspects influenced by the same gene . Dominance differs from epistasis , a relationship in which an allele of one gene affects the expression of another allele at a different gene . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Background <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Chromosomes , genes , and alleles </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Dominance <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Complete dominance </Li> <Li> 2.2 Incomplete dominance </Li> <Li> 2.3 Co-dominance </Li> <Li> 2.4 Addressing common misconceptions </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Nomenclature </Li> <Li> 4 Relationship to other genetic concepts <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Multiple alleles </Li> <Li> 4.2 Autosomal versus sex - linked dominance </Li> <Li> 4.3 Epistasis </Li> <Li> 4.4 Hardy - Weinberg principle ( estimation of carrier frequency ) </Li> <Li> 4.5 Dominant versus advantageous </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Molecular mechanisms <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Loss of function and haplosufficiency </Li> <Li> 5.2 Dominant - negative mutations </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Dominant and recessive genetic diseases in humans </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Background ( edit ) </H2> See also : Introduction to genetics <P> The concept of dominance was introduced by Gregor Johann Mendel . Though Mendel , `` The Father of Genetics '' , first used the term in the 1860s , it was not widely known until the early twentieth century . Mendel observed that , for a variety of traits of garden peas having to do with the appearance of seeds , seed pods , and plants , there were two discrete phenotypes , such as round versus wrinkled seeds , yellow versus green seeds , red versus white flowers or tall versus short plants . When bred separately , the plants always produced the same phenotypes , generation after generation . However , when lines with different phenotypes were crossed ( interbred ) , one and only one of the parental phenotypes showed up in the offspring ( green , or round , or red , or tall ) . However , when these hybrid plants were crossed , the offspring plants showed the two original phenotypes , in a characteristic 3 : 1 ratio , the more common phenotype being that of the parental hybrid plants . Mendel reasoned that each parent in the first cross was a homozygote for different alleles ( one parent AA and the other parent aa ) , that each contributed one allele to the offspring , with the result that all of these hybrids were heterozygotes ( Aa ) , and that one of the two alleles in the hybrid cross dominated expression of the other : A masked a . The final cross between two heterozygotes ( Aa X Aa ) would produce AA , Aa , and aa offspring in a 1 : 2 : 1 genotype ratio with the first two classes showing the ( A ) phenotype , and the last showing the ( a ) phenotype , thereby producing the 3 : 1 phenotype ratio . </P> <P> Mendel did not use the terms gene , allele , phenotype , genotype , homozygote , and heterozygote , all of which were introduced later . He did introduce the notation of capital and lowercase letters for dominant and recessive alleles , respectively , still in use today . </P> <H3> Chromosomes , genes , and alleles ( edit ) </H3> See also : Ploidy and Zygosity an autosomal dominant pattern . an autosomal recessive pattern . <P> Most animals and some plants have paired chromosomes , and are described as diploid . They have two versions of each chromosome , one contributed by the mother 's ovum , and the other by the father 's sperm , known as gametes , described as haploid , and created through meiosis . These gametes then fuse during fertilization during sexual reproduction , into a new single cell zygote , which divides multiple times , resulting in a new organism with the same number of pairs of chromosomes in each ( non-gamete ) cell as its parents . </P> <P> Each chromosome of a matching ( homologous ) pair is structurally similar to the other , and has a very similar DNA sequence ( loci , singular locus ) . The DNA in each chromosome functions as a series of discrete genes that influence various traits . Thus , each gene also has a corresponding homologue , which may exist in different versions called alleles . The alleles at the same locus on the two homologous chromosomes may be identical or different . </P> <P> Blood types in humans is determined by a gene that creates an A , B , AB or O blood type and is located in the long arm of chromosome nine . There are three different alleles that could be present at this locus , but only two can be present in any individual , one inherited from their mother and one from their father . </P> <P> If two alleles of a given gene are identical , the organism is called a homozygote and is said to be homozygous with respect to that gene ; if instead the two alleles are different , the organism is a heterozygote and is heterozygous . The genetic makeup of an organism , either at a single locus or over all its genes collectively , is called its genotype . The genotype of an organism directly and indirectly affects its molecular , physical , and other traits , which individually or collectively are called its phenotype . At heterozygous gene loci , the two alleles interact to produce the phenotype . </P> <H2> Dominance ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Complete dominance ( edit ) </H3> <P> In complete dominance , the effect of one allele in a heterozygous genotype completely masks the effect of the other . The allele that masks the other is said to be dominant to the latter , and the allele that is masked is said to be recessive to the former . Complete dominance , therefore , means that the phenotype of the heterozygote is indistinguishable from that of the dominant homozygote . </P> <P> A classic example of dominance is the inheritance of seed shape ( pea shape ) in peas . Peas may be round ( associated with allele R ) or wrinkled ( associated with allele r ) . In this case , three combinations of alleles ( genotypes ) are possible : RR and rr are homozygous and Rr is heterozygous . The RR individuals have round peas and the rr individuals have wrinkled peas . In Rr individuals the R allele masks the presence of the r allele , so these individuals also have round peas . Thus , allele R is completely dominant to allele r , and allele r is recessive to allele R . </P> <H3> Incomplete dominance ( edit ) </H3> This Punnett square illustrates incomplete dominance . In this example , the red petal trait associated with the R allele recombines with the white petal trait of the r allele . The plant incompletely expresses the dominant trait ( R ) causing plants with the Rr genotype to express flowers with less red pigment resulting in pink flowers . The colors are not blended together , the dominant trait is just expressed less strongly . <P> Incomplete dominance ( also called partial dominance , semi-dominance or intermediate inheritance ) occurs when the phenotype of the heterozygous genotype is distinct from and often intermediate to the phenotypes of the homozygous genotypes . For example , the snapdragon flower color is homozygous for either red or white . When the red homozygous flower is paired with the white homozygous flower , the result yields a pink snapdragon flower . The pink snapdragon is the result of incomplete dominance . A similar type of incomplete dominance is found in the four o'clock plant wherein pink color is produced when true - bred parents of white and red flowers are crossed . In quantitative genetics , where phenotypes are measured and treated numerically , if a heterozygote 's phenotype is exactly between ( numerically ) that of the two homozygotes , the phenotype is said to exhibit no dominance at all , i.e. dominance exists only when the heterozygote 's phenotype measure lies closer to one homozygote than the other . </P> <P> When plants of the F generation are self - pollinated , the phenotypic and genotypic ratio of the F generation will be 1 : 2 : 1 ( Red : Pink : White ) . </P> <P> See partial dominance hypothesis . </P> <H3> Co-dominance ( edit ) </H3> Co-dominance in a Camellia cultivar A and B blood types in humans show co-dominance , but the O type is recessive to A and B . This diagram shows co-dominance . In this example a white bull ( WW ) mates with a red cow ( RR ) , and their offspring exhibit co-dominance expressing both white and red hairs . <P> Co-dominance occurs when the contributions of both alleles are visible in the phenotype . </P> <P> For example , in the ABO blood group system , chemical modifications to a glycoprotein ( the H antigen ) on the surfaces of blood cells are controlled by three alleles , two of which are co-dominant to each other ( I , I ) and dominant over the recessive i at the ABO locus . The I and I alleles produce different modifications . The enzyme coded for by I adds an N - acetylgalactosamine to the membrane - bound H antigen . The I enzyme adds a galactose . The i allele produces no modification . Thus I and I alleles are each dominant to i ( I I and I i individuals both have type A blood , and I I and I i individuals both have type B blood , but I I individuals have both modifications on their blood cells and thus have type AB blood , so the I and I alleles are said to be co-dominant ) . </P> <P> Another example occurs at the locus for the Beta - globin component of hemoglobin , where the three molecular phenotypes of Hb / Hb , Hb / Hb , and Hb / Hb are all distinguishable by protein electrophoresis . ( The medical condition produced by the heterozygous genotype is called sickle - cell trait and is a milder condition distinguishable from sickle - cell anemia , thus the alleles show incomplete dominance with respect to anemia , see above ) . For most gene loci at the molecular level , both alleles are expressed co-dominantly , because both are transcribed into RNA . </P> <P> Co-dominance , where allelic products co-exist in the phenotype , is different from incomplete dominance , where the quantitative interaction of allele products produces an intermediate phenotype . For example , in co-dominance , a red homozygous flower and a white homozygous flower will produce offspring that have red and white spots . When plants of the F1 generation are self - pollinated , the phenotypic and genotypic ratio of the F2 generation will be 1 : 2 : 1 ( Red : Spotted : White ) . These ratios are the same as those for incomplete dominance . Again , note that this classical terminology is inappropriate -- in reality such cases should not be said to exhibit dominance at all . </P> <H3> Addressing common misconceptions ( edit ) </H3> <P> While it is often convenient to talk about a recessive allele or a dominant trait , dominance is not inherent to either an allele or its phenotype . Dominance is a relationship between two alleles of a gene and their associated phenotypes . A `` dominant '' allele is dominant to a particular allele of the same gene that can be inferred from the context , but it may be recessive to a third allele , and codominant to a fourth . Similarly , a `` recessive '' trait is a trait associated with a particular recessive allele implied by the context , but that same trait may occur in a different context where it is due to some other gene and a dominant allele . </P> <P> Dominance is unrelated to the nature of the phenotype itself , that is , whether it is regarded as `` normal '' or `` abnormal , '' `` standard '' or `` nonstandard , '' `` healthy '' or `` diseased , '' `` stronger '' or `` weaker , '' or more or less extreme . A dominant or recessive allele may account for any of these trait types . </P> <P> Dominance does not determine whether an allele is deleterious , neutral or advantageous . However , selection must operate on genes indirectly through phenotypes , and dominance affects the exposure of alleles in phenotypes , and hence the rate of change in allele frequencies under selection . Deleterious recessive alleles may persist in a population at low frequencies , with most copies carried in heterozygotes , at no cost to those individuals . These rare recessives are the basis for many hereditary genetic disorders . </P> <P> Dominance is also unrelated to the distribution of alleles in the population . Some dominant alleles are extremely common , while others are extremely rare . The most common allele in a population may be recessive when combined with some rare variants . </P> <H2> Nomenclature ( edit ) </H2> This section is about gene notations that identify dominance . For modern formal nomenclature , see Gene nomenclature . <P> In genetics , symbols began as algebraic placeholders . When one allele is dominant to another , the oldest convention is to symbolize the dominant allele with a capital letter . The recessive allele is assigned the same letter in lower case . In the pea example , once the dominance relationship between the two alleles is known , it is possible to designate the dominant allele that produces a round shape by a capital - letter symbol R , and the recessive allele that produces a wrinkled shape by a lower - case symbol r . The homozygous dominant , heterozygous , and homozygous recessive genotypes are then written RR , Rr , and rr , respectively . It would also be possible to designate the two alleles as W and w , and the three genotypes WW , Ww , and ww , the first two of which produced round peas and the third wrinkled peas . Note that the choice of `` R '' or `` W '' as the symbol for the dominant allele does not pre-judge whether the allele causing the `` round '' or `` wrinkled '' phenotype when homozygous is the dominant one . </P> <P> A gene may have several alleles . Each allele is symbolized by the locus symbol followed by a unique superscript . In many species , the most common allele in the wild population is designated the wild type allele . It is symbolized with a + character as a superscript . Other alleles are dominant or recessive to the wild type allele . For recessive alleles , the locus symbol is in lower case letters . For alleles with any degree of dominance to the wild type allele , the first letter of the locus symbol is in upper case . For example , here are some of the alleles at the a locus of the laboratory mouse , Mus musculus : A , dominant yellow ; a , wild type ; and a , black and tan . The a allele is recessive to the wild type allele , and the A allele is codominant to the wild type allele . The A allele is also codominant to the a allele , but showing that relationship is beyond the limits of the rules for mouse genetic nomenclature . </P> <P> Rules of genetic nomenclature have evolved as genetics has become more complex . Committees have standardized the rules for some species , but not for all . Rules for one species may differ somewhat from the rules for a different species . </P> <H2> Relationship to other genetic concepts ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Multiple alleles ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Allele § Multiple alleles <P> Although any individual of a diploid organism has at most two different alleles at any one locus ( barring aneuploidies ) , most genes exist in a large number of allelic versions in the population as a whole . If the alleles have different effects on the phenotype , sometimes their dominance interactions with each other can be described as a series . </P> <P> For example , coat color in domestic cats is affected by a series of alleles of the TYR gene ( which encodes the enzyme tyrosinase ) . The alleles C , c , c , and c ( full colour , Burmese , Siamese , and albino , respectively ) produce different levels of pigment and hence different levels of colour dilution . The C allele ( full colour ) is completely dominant over the last three and the c allele ( albino ) is completely recessive to the first three . </P> <H3> Autosomal versus sex - linked dominance ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Sex linkage <P> In humans and other mammal species , sex is determined by two sex chromosomes called the X chromosome and the Y chromosome . Human females are typically XX ; males are typically XY . The remaining pairs of chromosome are found in both sexes and are called autosomes ; genetic traits due to loci on these chromosomes are described as autosomal , and may be dominant or recessive . Genetic traits on the X and Y chromosomes are called sex - linked , because they are linked to sex chromosomes , not because they are characteristic of one sex or the other . In practice , the term almost always refers to X-linked traits and a great many such traits ( such as red - green colour vision deficiency ) are not affected by sex . Females have two copies of every gene locus found on the X chromosome , just as for the autosomes , and the same dominance relationships apply . Males however have only one copy of each X chromosome gene locus , and are described as hemizygous for these genes . The Y chromosome is much smaller than the X , and contains a much smaller set of genes , including , but not limited to , those that influence ' maleness ' , such as the SRY gene for testis determining factor . Dominance rules for sex - linked gene loci are determined by their behavior in the female : because the male has only one allele ( except in the case of certain types of Y chromosome aneuploidy ) , that allele is always expressed regardless of whether it is dominant or recessive . </P> <H3> Epistasis ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Epistasis <P> Epistasis ( `` epi + stasis = to sit on top '' ) is an interaction between alleles at two different gene loci that affect a single trait , which may sometimes resemble a dominance interaction between two different alleles at the same locus . Epistasis modifies the characteristic 9 : 3 : 3 : 1 ratio expected for two non-epistatic genes . For two loci , 14 classes of epistatic interactions are recognized . As an example of recessive epistasis , one gene locus may determine whether a flower pigment is yellow ( AA or Aa ) or green ( aa ) , while another locus determines whether the pigment is produced ( BB or Bb ) or not ( bb ) . In a bb plant , the flowers will be white , irrespective of the genotype of the other locus as AA , Aa , or aa . The bb combination is not dominant to the A allele : rather , the B gene shows recessive epistasis to the A gene , because the B locus when homozygous for the recessive allele ( bb ) suppresses phenotypic expression of the A locus . In a cross between two AaBb plants , this produces a characteristic 9 : 3 : 4 ratio , in this case of yellow : green : white flowers . </P> <P> In dominant epistasis , one gene locus may determine yellow or green pigment as in the previous example : AA and Aa are yellow , and aa are green . A second locus determines whether a pigment precursor is produced ( dd ) or not ( DD or Dd ) . Here , in a DD or Dd plant , the flowers will be colorless irrespective of the genotype at the A locus , because of the epistatic effect of the dominant D allele . Thus , in a cross between two AaDd plants , 3 / 4 of the plants will be colorless , and the yellow and green phenotypes are expressed only in dd plants . This produces a characteristic 12 : 3 : 1 ratio of white : yellow : green plants . </P> <P> Supplementary epistasis occurs when two loci affect the same phenotype . For example , if pigment color is produced by CC or Cc but not cc , and by DD or Dd but not dd , then pigment is not produced in any genotypic combination with either cc or dd . That is , both loci must have at least one dominant allele to produce the phenotype . This produces a characteristic 9 : 7 ratio of pigmented to unpigmented plants . Complementary epistasis in contrast produces an unpigmented plant if and only if the genotype is cc and dd , and the characteristic ratio is 15 : 1 between pigmented and unpigmented plants . </P> <P> Classical genetics considered epistatic interactions between two genes at a time . It is now evident from molecular genetics that all gene loci are involved in complex interactions with many other genes ( e.g. , metabolic pathways may involve scores of genes ) , and that this creates epistatic interactions that are much more complex than the classic two - locus models . </P> <H3> Hardy - Weinberg principle ( estimation of carrier frequency ) ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Hardy - Weinberg principle <P> The frequency of the heterozygous state ( which is the carrier state for a recessive trait ) can be estimated using the Hardy - Weinberg formula : p 2 + 2 p q + q 2 = 1 ( \\\\ displaystyle p ^ ( 2 ) + 2pq + q ^ ( 2 ) = 1 ) </P> <P> This formula applies to a gene with exactly two alleles and relates the frequencies of those alleles in a large population to the frequencies of their three genotypes in that population . </P> <P> For example , if p is the frequency of allele A , and q is the frequency of allele a then the terms p , 2pq , and q are the frequencies of the genotypes AA , Aa and aa respectively . Since the gene has only two alleles , all alleles must be either A or a and p + q = 1 . Now , if A is completely dominant to a then the frequency of the carrier genotype Aa can not be directly observed ( since it has the same traits as the homozygous genotype AA ) , however it can be estimated from the frequency of the recessive trait in the population , since this is the same as that of the homozygous genotype aa . i.e. the individual allele frequencies can be estimated : q = √ f ( aa ) , p = 1 − q , and from those the frequency of the carrier genotype can be derived : f ( Aa ) = 2pq . </P> <P> This formula relies on a number of assumptions and an accurate estimate of the frequency of the recessive trait . In general , any real - world situation will deviate from these assumptions to some degree , introducing corresponding inaccuracies into the estimate . If the recessive trait is rare , then it will be hard to estimate its frequency accurately , as a very large sample size will be needed . </P> <H3> Dominant versus advantageous ( edit ) </H3> <P> The property of `` dominant '' is sometimes confused with the concept of advantageous and the property of `` recessive '' is sometimes confused with the concept of deleterious , but the phenomena are distinct . Dominance describes the phenotype of heterozygotes with regard to the phenotypes of the homozygotes and without respect to the degree to which different phenotypes may be beneficial or deleterious . Since many genetic disease alleles are recessive and because the word dominance has a positive connotation , the assumption that the dominant phenotype is superior with respect to fitness is often made . This is not assured however ; as discussed below while most genetic disease alleles are deleterious and recessive , not all genetic diseases are recessive . </P> <P> Nevertheless , this confusion has been pervasive throughout the history of genetics and persists to this day . Addressing this confusion was one of the prime motivations for the publication of the Hardy - Weinberg principle . </P> <H2> Molecular mechanisms ( edit ) </H2> <P> The molecular basis of dominance was unknown to Mendel . It is now understood that a gene locus includes a long series ( hundreds to thousands ) of bases or nucleotides of deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) at a particular point on a chromosome . The central dogma of molecular biology states that `` DNA makes RNA makes protein '' , that is , that DNA is transcribed to make an RNA copy , and RNA is translated to make a protein . In this process , different alleles at a locus may or may not be transcribed , and if transcribed may be translated to slightly different versions of the same protein ( called isoforms ) . Proteins often function as enzymes that catalyze chemical reactions in the cell , which directly or indirectly produce phenotypes . In any diploid organism , the DNA sequences of the two alleles present at any gene locus may be identical ( homozygous ) or different ( heterozygous ) . Even if the gene locus is heterozygous at the level of the DNA sequence , the proteins made by each allele may be identical . In the absence of any difference between the protein products , neither allele can be said to be dominant ( see co-dominance , above ) . Even if the two protein products are slightly different ( allozymes ) , it is likely that they produce the same phenotype with respect to enzyme action , and again neither allele can be said to be dominant . </P> <H3> Loss of function and haplosufficiency ( edit ) </H3> <P> Dominance typically occurs when one of the two alleles is non-functional at the molecular level , that is , it is not transcribed or else does not produce a functional protein product . This can be the result of a mutation that alters the DNA sequence of the allele . An organism homozygous for the non-functional allele will generally show a distinctive phenotype , due to the absence of the protein product . For example , in humans and other organisms , the unpigmented skin of the albino phenotype results when an individual is homozygous for an allele that encodes a non-functional version of an enzyme needed to produce the skin pigment melanin . It is important to understand that it is not the lack of function that allows the allele to be described as recessive : this is the interaction with the alternative allele in the heterozygote . Three general types of interaction are possible : </P> <Ol> <Li> In the typical case , the single functional allele makes sufficient protein to produce a phenotype identical to that of the homozygote : this is called haplosufficiency . For example , suppose the standard amount of enzyme produced in the functional homozygote is 100 % , with the two functional alleles contributing 50 % each . The single functional allele in the heterozygote produces 50 % of the standard amount of enzyme , which is sufficient to produce the standard phenotype . If the heterozygote and the functional - allele homozygote have identical phenotypes , the functional allele is dominant to the non-functional allele . This occurs at the albino gene locus : the heterozygote produces sufficient enzyme to convert the pigment precursor to melanin , and the individual has standard pigmentation . </Li> <Li> Less commonly , the presence of a single functional allele gives a phenotype that is not normal but less severe than that of the non-functional homozygote . This occurs when the functional allele is not haplo - sufficient . The terms haplo - insufficiency and incomplete dominance are typically applied to these cases . The intermediate interaction occurs where the heterozygous genotype produces a phenotype intermediate between the two homozygotes . Depending on which of the two homozygotes the heterozygote most resembles , one allele is said to show incomplete dominance over the other . For example , in humans the Hb gene locus is responsible for the Beta - chain protein ( HBB ) that is one of the two globin proteins that make up the blood pigment hemoglobin Many people are homozygous for an allele called Hb ; some persons carry an alternative allele called Hb , either as homozygotes or heterozygotes . The hemoglobin molecules of Hb / Hb homozygotes undergo a change in shape that distorts the morphology of the red blood cells , and causes a severe , life - threatening form of anemia called sickle - cell anemia . Persons heterozygous Hb / Hb for this allele have a much less severe form of anemia called sickle - cell trait . Because the disease phenotype of Hb / Hb heterozygotes is more similar to but not identical to the Hb / Hb homozygote , the Hb allele is said to be incompletely dominant to the Hb allele . </Li> <Li> Rarely , a single functional allele in the heterozygote may produce insufficient gene product for any function of the gene , and the phenotype resembles that of the homozygote for the non-functional allele . This complete haploinsufficiency is very unusual . In these cases the non-functional allele would be said to be dominant to the functional allele . This situation may occur when the non-functional allele produces a defective protein that interferes with the proper function of the protein produced by the standard allele . The presence of the defective protein `` dominates '' the standard protein , and the disease phenotype of the heterozygote more closely resembles that of the homozygote for two defective alleles . Note that the term dominant is often incorrectly applied to defective alleles whose homozygous phenotype has not been examined , but which cause a distinct phenotype when heterozygous with the normal allele . This phenomenon occurs in a number of trinucleotide repeat diseases : for an example and more details see Huntington Disease . </Li> </Ol> <H3> Dominant - negative mutations ( edit ) </H3> <P> Many proteins are normally active in the form of a multimer , an aggregate of multiple copies of the same protein , otherwise known as a homomultimeric protein or homooligomeric protein . In fact , a majority of the 83,000 different enzymes from 9800 different organisms in the BRENDA Enzyme Database represent homooligomers . When the wild - type version of the protein is present along with a mutant version , a mixed multimer can be formed . A mutation that leads to a mutant protein that disrupts the activity of the wild - type protein in the multimer is a dominant - negative mutation . </P> <P> A dominant - negative mutation may arise in a human somatic cell and provide a proliferative advantage to the mutant cell , leading to its clonal expansion . For instance , a dominant - negative mutation in a gene necessary for the normal process of programmed cell death ( Apoptosis ) in response to DNA damage can make the cell resistant to apoptosis . This will allow proliferation of the clone even when excessive DNA damage is present . Such dominant - negative mutations occur in the tumor suppressor gene p53 . The P53 wild - type protein is normally present as a four - protein multimer ( oligotetramer ) . Dominant - negative p53 mutations occur in a number of different types of cancer and pre-cancerous lesions ( e.g. brain tumors , breast cancer , oral pre-cancerous lesions and oral cancer ) . </P> <P> Dominant - negative mutations also occur in other tumor suppressor genes . For instance two dominant - negative germ line mutations were identified in the Ataxia telangiectasia mutated ( ATM ) gene which increases susceptibility to breast cancer . Dominant negative mutations of the transcription factor C / EBPα can cause acute myeloid leukemia . Inherited dominant negative mutations can also increase the risk of diseases other than cancer . Dominant - negative mutations in Peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor gamma ( PPARγ ) are associated with severe insulin resistance , diabetes mellitus and hypertension . </P> <P> Dominant - negative mutations have also been described in organisms other than humans . In fact , the first study reporting a mutant protein inhibiting the normal function of a wild - type protein in a mixed multimer was with the bacteriophage T4 tail fiber protein GP37 . Mutations that produce a truncated protein rather than a full - length mutant protein seem to have the strongest dominant - negative effect in the studies of P53 , ATM , C / EBPα , and bacteriophage T4 GP37 . </P> <H2> Dominant and recessive genetic diseases in humans ( edit ) </H2> <P> In humans , many genetic traits or diseases are classified simply as `` dominant '' or `` recessive '' . Especially with so - called recessive diseases , which are indeed a factor of recessive genes , but can oversimplify the underlying molecular basis and lead to misunderstanding of the nature of dominance . For example , the recessive genetic disease phenylketonuria ( PKU ) results from any of a large number ( > 60 ) of alleles at the gene locus for the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ) . Many of these alleles produce little or no PAH , as a result of which the substrate phenylalanine ( Phe ) and its metabolic byproducts accumulate in the central nervous system and can cause severe intellectual disability if untreated . </P> <P> The genotypes and phenotypic consequences of interactions among three alleles are shown in the following table : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Genotype </Th> <Th> PAH activity </Th> <Th> ( Phe ) conc </Th> <Th> PKU ? </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> AA </Td> <Td> 100 % </Td> <Td> 60 uM </Td> <Td> No </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> AB </Td> <Td> 30 % </Td> <Td> 120 uM </Td> <Td> No </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> CC </Td> <Td> 5 % </Td> <Td> 200 ~ 300 uM </Td> <Td> Hyperphenylalaninemia </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> BB </Td> <Td> 0.3 % </Td> <Td> 600 ~ 2400 uM </Td> <Td> Yes </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> In unaffected persons homozygous for a standard functional allele ( AA ) , PAH activity is standard ( 100 % ) , and the concentration of phenylalanine in the blood ( Phe ) is about 60 uM . In untreated persons homozygous for one of the PKU alleles ( BB ) , PAH activity is close to zero , ( Phe ) ten to forty times standard , and the individual manifests PKU . </P> <P> In the AB heterozygote , PAH activity is only 30 % ( not 50 % ) of standard , blood ( Phe ) is elevated two-fold , and the person does not manifest PKU . Thus , the A allele is dominant to the B allele with respect to PKU , but the B allele is incompletely dominant to the A allele with respect to its molecular effect , determination of PAH activity level ( 0.3 % < 30 % < < 100 % ) . Finally , the A allele is an incomplete dominant to B with respect to ( Phe ) , as 60 uM < 120 uM < < 600 uM . Note once more that it is irrelevant to the question of dominance that the recessive allele produces a more extreme ( Phe ) phenotype . </P> <P> For a third allele C , a CC homozygote produces a very small amount of PAH enzyme , which results in a somewhat elevated level of ( Phe ) in the blood , a condition called hyperphenylalaninemia , which does not result in intellectual disability . </P> <P> That is , the dominance relationships of any two alleles may vary according to which aspect of the phenotype is under consideration . It is typically more useful to talk about the phenotypic consequences of the allelic interactions involved in any genotype , rather than to try to force them into dominant and recessive categories . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Evolution of dominance </Li> <Li> List of Mendelian traits in humans </Li> <Li> Mitochondrial DNA </Li> <Li> Punnett square </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` dominance '' .
